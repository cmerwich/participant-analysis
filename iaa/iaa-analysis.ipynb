    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates and analyses the calculations of inter-annotator agreement, abbreviated to IAA, for the annotation of coreference information in the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Psalms. The Psalms, consisting of 150 poems in Ancient Hebrew, have been chosen as annotation corpus because they are the focus of my PhD research: \"Who is who in the Psalms?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The Psalms and some comparison texts from Genesis, Numbers and Isaiah, have been annotated according to certain rules: an annotation scheme. A brief explanation of what data is annotated, the process and accompanying annotation tools and resources can be found in the [coreference annotation](https://github.com/cmerwich/participant-analysis/tree/master/annotation) notebooks. Why comparison texts have been annotated is explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vital part of the annotation process is checking the annotations for inter-annotator agreement. A website on [corpus linguistics](https://corpuslinguisticmethods.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/what-is-inter-annotator-agreement) puts it nicely: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Inter-annotator agreement is a measure of how well two (or more) annotators can make the same annotation decision for a certain category.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "From an IAA measure at least three things can be derived: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the *reliability* of the annotation scheme or guidelines that describe the category that is being annotated. Do the annotators understand the scheme and can they apply it *independently* and *consistently*? \n",
    "* the *reliability* of the annotation process, which is a necessary condition for \n",
    "* the *correctness* of the resulting annotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is create a coreference annotation method for the Hebrew Bible that can be used, adapted and corrected by others. In order to do that, we need to know to what extent the annotated information is correct. Producing reliable, consistent and correct coreference annotations are key to developing solid computer-assisted analyses of participants in the Psalms and other Hebrew Bible books. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Setting up IAA\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope and financial means of the PhD project do not allow for setting up a large scale IAA process with a team of annotators ranging in level of expertise. Two annotators were available for the current project. In the calculations I therefore function as annotator **A** and a fellow PhD candidate, Gyusang Jin, as annotator **B**. \n",
    "\n",
    "10 texts out of 150 Psalms were chosen randomly for annotator **B** with Python's `random` module since the whole Psalms corpus was already annotated by **A**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "import random \n",
    "for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "    print(random.randint(1, 151))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output was 11, 88, 101, 17, 70, 138, 20, 32, 67, 129. After a training in the annotation guidelines, **B** started annotating. The 10 resulting annotation files of **B** together with **A**'s annotation files form the input for the IAA algorithm. The annotation files are found under [A](chris_A) and [B](gyus_B). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Psalms corpus consists of poetry that is written in Biblical Hebrew. The annotator therefore does not only have to deal with difficulties when trying to understand texts written in a different genre and language, they have also originated in a different space and time. A question that comes up is if it is harder to annotate poetic texts for coreference compared to for example narrative texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable some comparison between the annotation of different genres Numbers 8-10, which are narrative texts, were also annotated for coreference by **A** and **B**. The processing of the Numbers annotations however is in work in progress and will be included as soon as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Some Theory and the IAA Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all kinds of algorithms for IAA measures. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.metrics.html) has implemented some of these agreement metrics. [Artstein and Poesio](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1479206) wrote an informative article on the mathematics of IAA in 2008. I have decided to implement my own algorithm that uses SciPy's [lignear sum assignment module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html). This gives me more control over the algorithm's output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating IAA for coreference annotations in the Hebrew Bible is cast as an assignment problem. A classic assignment problem is e.g. to assign jobs *{p, q, r, s}* to workers *{a, b, c, d}* so as to minimize the total cost. [Here](http://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html) you can find a nice explanation of this 'Kuhn-Munkres algorithm'. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) is also helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of IAA for our case is as follows. Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A referring expression is called a **mention**. \n",
    "* An entity can be called a **class**, or **C**. A **class** is a set that contains two or more mentions that refer to the same entity. \n",
    "* A mention that refers to an entity that no other mention refers to is called a **singleton**, or **S**. A **singleton** is a set that contains one **mention**. A **singleton** set can also contain all singletons from one text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing annotations of `annotator A` and `annotator B` then is done with set calculations. Given the Venn diagram (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)) below, for IAA we are interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/venn_a_intersect_b.png\" width=\"220\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A \\setminus B$ = Left, or blue\n",
    "* $A \\cap B$ = Middle, or purple\n",
    "* $B \\setminus A$ = Right, or pink\n",
    "* $A \\Delta B$ = Symmetric difference of A and B\n",
    "* $\\delta(A, B)$ = delta of A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, in the following example\n",
    "\n",
    "| $\\setminus$ | A  | $\\cap$ | B | $\\setminus$ |\n",
    "| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n",
    "| 0 | C1 | 4 | C1 | 1 |  \n",
    "| 1 | C2 | 7 | C2 | 1 |\n",
    "| 8 | C3 | 0 | C3 | 0 |\n",
    "| 3 | S  | 17 | S  | 2 |  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "annotator **A** and annotator **B** have 4 mentions in common in *C1*, **B** has 1 mention more in *C1* than **A**. **A** and **B** have 7 mentions in common in *C2*. Both have annotated 1 mention that they not have in common. For *S*, **A** and **B** have an intersection of 17. For **A** the relative complement, or difference, is 3; for **B** it's 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that **A** or **B** has formed a class the other has not: the *C3* class is an example of that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric difference is the calculation of the annotations that belong to **A** or **B** but not to their intersection (Middle). Symmetric difference is defined for sets **A**, **B** as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\Delta B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the symmetric distance between **A** and **B** for *C1* is $0+1 = 1$. $A \\Delta B$ for *S* is 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notation for the $\\delta$ (delta) of a set is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta = A \\Delta B / A \\cup B $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The delta of *S* for example is: $(3+2)/(3+17+2) \\approx 0.227 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "To return to the assignment problem, the annotations of **A** and **B** can be divided as respectively $n$ and $k$ nodes into two disjoint and independent sets $U$ and $V$ in an acyclic bipartite graph (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)). In this bipartite graph every edge connects a node in $U$ to one in $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/bipartite-graph.png\" width=\"220\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "In the [IAA algorithm](iaa.py) then, **A** and **B** (or $U$ and $V$) are matched with function `match()` using a distance function `distance()` that calculates the symmetric distance. The cost of the matching is calculated with the aforementioned `linear_sum_assignment` SciPy module. The results of the matching are stored in array $r$. The rest of the functions are helper functions that print the calculations to plain text files with extension `.iaa`. These `.iaa` files are found [here](iaa-files). "

    "### 2. Executing the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable researchers to develop their own annotation process, with different annotators working in different file locations, I have decided to work with a [`Makefile`](Makefile). A `Makefile` does all of the file handling in the terminal, it prevents dependency hell when the annotators decide to change their files after the IAA calculations have been done. With the command `make` the calculations are easily done again. Some instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* make an \"iaa\"-folder (or give it some other name) somewhere on your computer and place the `iaa.py`, `acc.py` and `Makefile` in that same folder;\n",
    "* change the file locations for the `.ann` files under NU_A, PS_A etc. in the `Makefile`. Make sure there are **A** and **B** locations for the files of the two different annotators; \n",

Of the word MIM.EN.IJ, 'from me', in v. 101:4 **A** annotated NJ, where **B** annotated J. According to the `annotation_resources` and the annotation guidelines J is an annotation mistake, since ETCBC's analysed form is (M(N&M&N+(NJ and NJ should be annotated. It is therefore categorised as one *Annotator Error*. \n",
    "    -----------------------------------------------------------   \n",
    "1. C3 - C4 $\\delta \\approx 0.6667$: \n",
    "    * Where **A** has annotated 'heart' ('LBB'), **B** has also annotated the adjective: 'crooked heart' ('LBB <QC'). Though the annotation guidelines indeed allow for the annotation of adjectives as mention, they are not coreferenced with other referents by themselves. Conversely, **A** annotates 'DRK' ('way', see point 5 below)  without the adjective 'TMJM' ('complete'), but annotates 'TMJM' as a seperate mention, which is incorrect, and adds it to his *S* class. **B** has not annotated 'TMJM' as mention. The annotation guidelines therefore need to be revised. These two errors are categorised as *Guidelines*. \n",
    "    -----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "1. C4 - C5 $\\delta = 0.75$: \n",
    "    * In 101:5 **A** incorrectly annotated 'W' instead of 'HW', like **B** did. Both 'W' and 'HW' are suffix forms of 3Msg. The `annotation_resources` and the annotation guidelines indicate for R;<;HW ('his neighbour') that the suffix (R<=/+HW) 'HW' should be annotated. This error is categorised as one *Annotator Error*. As a consequence 'R<H' is added to **A**'s *S* class instead of **B**'s correct 'R<'.  \n",
    "    * In the same verse **B**, in contrast to **A**, did not corefer the participle 'MLWCNJ' ('he who slanders') to his class and ended up as singleton in *S*. The same goes for the second 'W' which **A** corefered to this class and **B** did not, making it a singleton. Though 'MLWCNJ' is determined as a participle (Msg) and does not have a person feature that refers to the ensuing 3Msg suffixes, they do corefer. These two errors are categorised as *Annotator Error*. \n",

    "1. C5 - C3 $\\delta = 1.0$: \n",
    "    * In this match **A** corefers 'LBB' ('heart') with 'W' in 101:5. As the suffix 'W' is attached to an object marker ('>T'), the 3Msg refers to 'he who slanders' (cf. point 3 (C4 - C5)), not to 'heart'. This is an *Annotator Error*. **B** has not corefered 'W' and 'LBB', hence they are added to his *S* class. \n",
    "    * **B** corefers 'JDBQ' with 'DBR&BLJ<L' in 101:3. The question is if 'JDBQ', (verb, 3Msg, to cling to), and 'DBR&BLJ<L' (NP, 'word of wickedness', both words are Msg) corefer. 'DBR&BLJ<L' occurs in a clause that does not directly precede 'JDBQ'. 'JDBQ' is preceded by the clause 'I hate the doing of (the) faithless'. It is therefore more probable that 'JDBQ' corefers as follows: 'the doing of the faithless, it/he does not cling to me'. Both **A** and **B** have made an *Annotator Error*, which can be counted as two. For **A** that means that 'JDBQ' and 'DBR&BLJ<L' are added to his *S* class. \n",

If **A** were to be followed, 'he' ('HW>') would refer to 'the way' ('DRK'), and the way would 'serve': 'the way, he, he, serves'. This is not correct since 'he' ('HW>') is subject of 'JCRT' 'he serves'. This error is categorised as one *Annotator Error*. \n",

    "    * **A** and **B** have annotated three occurrences of '<JN' (substantive, determined by a suffix 1Csg, 'eye') in 101:3, 101:6 and 101:7 differently. **A** correctly coreferences two occurrences of the determined substantive making it an unmatched class (*C6*). **A** also misses one occurrence ('<JN', 15, in *S*) hence making it one *Annotator Error*. **B** annotates all mentions, 2x ('NGD <JN', 7), 1x ('<JN', 17), but does not corefer them. These are three *Annotator Error*s. Furthermore **B** annotates 'NGD <JN' in 101:3 and 101:7. Strictly speaking the annotation guidelines allow for the annotation of 'NGD', meaning 'counterpart' or 'before', but this substantive seems to function more as a preposition. The difference in translation is 'the counterpart of my eyes' versus 'before my eyes'. **B** has chosen the former, **A** the latter. These two errors are categorised as *Guidelines*. The guidelines should be adjusted. \n",
    "    * Whereas **B**'s has added 'QRB BJT' to his *S* class, **A** adds the two occurrences to a separate class (*C9*). 'QRB BJT', 'the interior of the house' occurs in 101:2 and 101:7 and both NP's are determined by a suffix 1Csg. They should therefore be coreferenced in a class as **A** has done. **B** has made two *Annotator Error*s. \n",
    "    * Though **A** has coreferenced one occurrence of 'DRK' to his *C8* class, he has also missed an occurrence that **B** has added to his *S* class. 'DRK' occurs in 101:2 and 101:5. **A** has made an *NP* error. \n",
    "    * Lastly, **A** annotates an additional and unpaired *C7* class with 'N>MNJ&>RY' and 'HLK'. It is however not 'N>MNJ&>RY' ('faithful in the land') that should be coreferenced with 'HLK' (particple, Msg, 'he who walks'), but 'HW>' and 'JCRT' from the *C8 - C6* match making it: 'he who walks, he, he, serves'.

    "    * **A** and **B** recognise a 'JHWH' ('God') class in their *C1* and *C11* classes respectively. **A** has added nine mentions more to his class than **B**. These 9 mentions plus 'MWCJ<' are **B**'s *C6* class which is matched with **A**'s *C12* further down. **A** adds 'MWCJ<' in 17:7 (NP vocative, Msg, 'saviour'/'helper') to his singleton set. The difference of mentions as indicated by **A**'s diff for this *C1* - *C11* matching seems to be caused by a linking error made in brat by **B**. All mentions (verbs: 'HV', 'CM<', 'HPLH', 'CMR', 'TSTJR'; suffixes 'K') refer in 2Msg to God. **A** forgot to link 'MWCJ<' to this class: one *Annotator Error*. **B**'s linking error is counted as nine *Annotator Error*'s. Making it 10 *Annotator Error*s. \n",

    "1. C6 - C5 $\\delta \\approx 0.3103$: \n",
    "    * **A** adds seven mentions to his *C6* class that **B** misses. **B**'s diff indicates that he has added two mentions ('DWD' and  'TJ') that **A** misses. Starting with those, 'DWD' (nomen proprium, 'David') belongs to the title of Ps 17. As was the case with Ps 67, according to the guidelines titles of Psalms are annotated for coreference but are not connected to coreference information in the rest of the Psalm. 'TJ' is supposed to be the suffix 1Csg 'J', it is connected to '>MRT' ('word') in 17:6, but **B** has erroneously also annotated the 'T'. **B**'s 'DWD' and  'TJ' are 2 *Annotator Error*s. This also explains two of the differences in **A**'s and **B**'s *S*, namely: 'DWD' and '>MRT'. \n",
    "    * For the remaining differences, the seven mentions in **A**'s *C6*, there are two explanations. The first one is that the difference is a result of *Genuine Ambiguity*. In the *C11* - *C8* match, **B**'s *C8* agrees with **A**'s seven mentions, except for '>FB<H' (verb, 1Csg, 'to be sated') and the aforementioned (T)'J' suffix 1Csg. While **B** explictely identifies his *C5*, which contains 1Csg mentions, as 'David'. **A** leaves the 1Csg mentions class unidentified. Possibly, **B** started a new coreference class because of the sudden occurrence of the suffix 'NW' (1Cpl) in 17:11. Strangely, **B** adds '>XZH' (verb, 1Csg, 'to see') in 17:15 to his *C8* class, but leaves '>FB<H' in the same verse out which is then added to *S*. In terms of consistency '>FB<H', 'I am sated', should also have been added to this class. The second explanation - the difference is a result of an *Annotator Error* - is therefore more probable. **B** did not link the all the 1Csg mentions correctly. We count 6 *Annotator Error*'s. \n",

    "    * These two matchings are discussed in relation to each other. \n",
    "    * In 17:7 **A** incorrectly links 'XWSJM' to 'MTQWMMJM'. 'XWSJM' (participle, Mpl, 'to seek refuge'), translated as 'they\\those who seek refuge' is not the same referent as 'MTQWMMJM' (participle, Mpl, 'to arise'), 'they/those who arise'. The translation of this part of 17:7 would be: 'Oh you helper [God] for those who seek refuge from those who arise against your [God] right hand'. 'XWSJM' and 'MTQWMMJM' therefore end up in **A**'s *S* class. We categorise and count 2 *Annotator Error*'s. \n",
    "    * **A** and **B** differ on their understanding of the lion metaphor in 17:12 with translation: 'His likeness is of a lion, he longs to tear; and like a young lion who sits in a hiding place'. **B** annotates two classes. **B** links 'KPJR' ('young lion') to 'JCB' (participle, Msg, 'to sit') in 17:12 in a separate class *C10*. **A** links these two mentions to '>RJH' ('lion') and 'JKSWP' (verb, 3Msg, to 'to long') in one *C10* class: '>RJH', 'JKSWP', 'KPJR', 'JCB'.  **B** adds 'VRWP' (infinitive cst, 'to tear') to his *C10*. According to the annotation guidelines infinitives are not annotated unless there is lexical identity with the same verb elsewhere. 'To tear' does not occur elsewhere in the 17, 'VRWP' is therefore 1 *Annotator Error*. The question is then: do 'the lion' and 'the young lion' corefer or not, are they the same referents? Though a young lion is still a lion, it is probable in this text that the two lions are not the same. Therefore: 1 case of *Referents*. \n",

'PNJ RC<JM' (NP, Mpl, 'faces of the wicked') does not corefer with 'RC<' (NP, Msg, 'a wicked') which has a singular form. 'CDW' (verb, 3Cpl, 'to despoil') corefers with the plural of'PNJ RC<JM'. This is counted as 1 *Annotator Error*. \n",
    "    * **B** links 'PNJ RC<JM' and 'CDW' together with 'NVWT' (infinitive, 'to extend') to his *C7*. Since infinitives are not annotated as mention, 'NVWT' is categorised as 1 *Annotator Error*. \n",
    "    * Where **A** sees the 'faces of the wicked' as a separate class from the '>JB' (participle, Mpl, 'be hostile'/'enemies) class (*C9*) that starts in 17:9, **B** considers 'PNJ RC<JM' and '>JB' belonging to one class (*C7*). Whether 'the faces of the wicked' and 'the enemies' refer to the same entity is hard to say. Therefore, these differences between **A** and **B** are categorised as 2 cases of *Genuine Ambiguity*, one for **A** and one for **B**. \n",

    "    * Leaving **B**'s *C8* out of consideration, since it has already been discussed under point 2, **A** distinguishes a 'NPC' (Fsg, 'soul') class. **B** has annotated them as two singletons. The first occurrence of 'NPC' in 17:9 is an undetermined NP, but clearly refers to the soul of the I person that is being threatened by enemies. This can be inferred from the three suffixes 1Csg that occur in this verse. The 'I', the 'NPC' or self is under threat. The second occurence of 'NPC' in 17:13 is a determined NP with a 1Csg suffix. Here the same I person asks God to save him ('my soul') from 'the sword' (i.e. a threat) of the enemy. These two differences are categorised as 2 cases of *Genuine Ambiguity*. \n",

    "    * The annotation choices made by **A** and **B** in 17:14 are best understood when discussing the three matchings in relation to each other. **A**'s *C12* consists of 2x 'MTJM' (substantive, Mpl, 'man'); **B**'s *C6* has already been discussed under point 1 above. **A** distinguishes a separate *C13* class with two suffixes 3Mpl ('M'). **B** connects one occurence of 'MTJM' to the two 3Mpl suffixes together with 'HNJXW' (verb, 3Cpl, 'to settle'), 'M', and 'HM' (both 3Mpl suffixes). **B** this identifies the 3Mpl mentions as 'a man/a people' ('MTJM'). **B** correctly connects 'M' and 'M' with 'MTJM', but forgets to connect the second 'MTJM', which is thus added to his singletons. That **A** missing a link between his *C12* and *C13* is 1 *Annotator Error*. **B** forgetting the second 'MTJM' is also 1 *Annotator Error*. (2)\n",
    "    * As mentioned **B** adds 'HNJXW', 'M' and 'HM' to his *C13*. **A** however considers 'JFB<W', 'BNJM', 'HNJXW', 'M' and 'HM' as one class (*C14*) of which 'BNJM' (substantive NP, Mpl, 'children') is the subject. **B** sees a separate class in 'JFB<W' and 'BNJM' (*C12*). The subject of 'HNJXW' is, as **A** has annotated, 'BNJM' and not 'MTJM'. This is categorised as one *Referents* error. In addition, **B** does not link his *C12* to his *C13* and is therefore categorised as 1 *Annotator Error*. \n",

The same goes for '>JCWN BT&<JN' ('pupil of the eye'), which matches **B**'s 'JCWN BT&<JN': here the aleph is also missing. That makes 3 *Annotator Error*s. \n",
