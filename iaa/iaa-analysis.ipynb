    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates and analyses the calculations of inter-annotator agreement, abbreviated to IAA, for the annotation of coreference information in the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Psalms. The Psalms, consisting of 150 poems in Ancient Hebrew, have been chosen as annotation corpus because they are the focus of my PhD research: \"Who is who in the Psalms?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The Psalms and some comparison texts from Genesis, Numbers and Isaiah, have been annotated according to certain rules: an annotation scheme. A brief explanation of what data is annotated, the process and accompanying annotation tools and resources can be found in the [coreference annotation](https://github.com/cmerwich/participant-analysis/tree/master/annotation) notebooks. Why comparison texts have been annotated is explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vital part of the annotation process is checking the annotations for inter-annotator agreement. A website on [corpus linguistics](https://corpuslinguisticmethods.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/what-is-inter-annotator-agreement) puts it nicely: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Inter-annotator agreement is a measure of how well two (or more) annotators can make the same annotation decision for a certain category.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "From an IAA measure at least three things can be derived: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the *reliability* of the annotation scheme or guidelines that describe the category that is being annotated. Do the annotators understand the scheme and can they apply it *independently* and *consistently*? \n",
    "* the *reliability* of the annotation process, which is a necessary condition for \n",
    "* the *correctness* of the resulting annotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is create a coreference annotation method for the Hebrew Bible that can be used, adapted and corrected by others. In order to do that, we need to know to what extent the annotated information is correct. Producing reliable, consistent and correct coreference annotations are key to developing solid computer-assisted analyses of participants in the Psalms and other Hebrew Bible books. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Setting up IAA\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope and financial means of the PhD project do not allow for setting up a large scale IAA process with a team of annotators ranging in level of expertise. Two annotators were available for the current project. In the calculations I therefore function as annotator **A** and a fellow PhD candidate, Gyusang Jin, as annotator **B**. \n",
    "\n",
    "10 texts out of 150 Psalms were chosen randomly for annotator **B** with Python's `random` module since the whole Psalms corpus was already annotated by **A**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "import random \n",
    "for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "    print(random.randint(1, 151))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output was 11, 88, 101, 17, 70, 138, 20, 32, 67, 129. After a training in the annotation guidelines, **B** started annotating. The 10 resulting annotation files of **B** together with **A**'s annotation files form the input for the IAA algorithm. The annotation files are found under [A](chris_A) and [B](gyus_B). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Psalms corpus consists of poetry that is written in Biblical Hebrew. The annotator therefore does not only have to deal with difficulties when trying to understand texts written in a different genre and language, they have also originated in a different space and time. A question that comes up is if it is harder to annotate poetic texts for coreference compared to for example narrative texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable some comparison between the annotation of different genres Numbers 8-10, which are narrative texts, were also annotated for coreference by **A** and **B**. The Numbers annotations will be analysed at the end of this notebook. The hypothesis for the comparison between coreference annotations in poetry and narrative texts is that annotators **A** and **B** will agree more on their annotations of the narrative texts than on the poetic texts. We will see if this indeed the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Some Theory and the IAA Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all kinds of algorithms for IAA measures. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.metrics.html) has implemented some of these agreement metrics. [Artstein and Poesio](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1479206) wrote an informative article on the mathematics of IAA in 2008. I have decided to implement my own algorithm that uses SciPy's [linear sum assignment module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html). This gives me more control over the algorithm's output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating IAA for coreference annotations in the Hebrew Bible is cast as an assignment problem. A classic assignment problem is e.g. to assign jobs *{p, q, r, s}* to workers *{a, b, c, d}* so as to minimize the total cost. [Here](http://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html) you can find a nice explanation of this 'Kuhn-Munkres algorithm'. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) is also helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of IAA for our case is as follows. Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A referring expression is called a **mention**. \n",
    "* An entity can be called a **class**, or **C**. A **class** is a set that contains two or more mentions that refer to the same entity. \n",
    "* A mention that refers to an entity that no other mention refers to is called a **singleton**. A **singleton** can be a set that contains one **mention**. I define a **singleton** set **S** that contains all singletons from one text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing annotations of `annotator A` and `annotator B` then is done with set calculations. Given the Venn diagram (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)) below, for IAA we are interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/venn_a_intersect_b.png\" width=\"220\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A \\setminus B$ = Left, or blue\n",
    "* $A \\cap B$ = Middle, or purple\n",
    "* $B \\setminus A$ = Right, or pink\n",
    "* $A \\Delta B$ = Symmetric difference of A and B\n",
    "* $d_{j}(A, B)$ = [Jaccard distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) of A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, in the following example\n",
    "\n",
    "| $\\setminus$ | A  | $\\cap$ | B | $\\setminus$ |\n",
    "| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n",
    "| 0 | C1 | 4 | C1 | 1 |  \n",
    "| 1 | C2 | 7 | C2 | 1 |\n",
    "| 8 | C3 | 0 | C3 | 0 |\n",
    "| 3 | S  | 17 | S  | 2 |  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "annotator **A** and annotator **B** have 4 mentions in common in *C1*, **B** has 1 mention more in *C1* than **A**. **A** and **B** have 7 mentions in common in *C2*. Both have annotated 1 mention that they not have in common. For *S*, **A** and **B** have an intersection of 17. For **A** the relative complement, or difference, is 3; for **B** it's 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that **A** or **B** has formed a class the other has not: the *C3* class is an example of that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric difference is the calculation of the annotations that belong to **A** or **B** but not to their intersection (Middle). Symmetric difference is defined for sets **A**, **B** as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\Delta B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the symmetric distance between **A** and **B** for *C1* is $0+1 = 1$. $A \\Delta B$ for *S* is 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notation for the $d_{j}$ (distance) of a set is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{j} = A \\Delta B / A \\cup B $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance for *S* for example is: $(3+2)/(3+17+2) \\approx 0.227 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "To return to the assignment problem, the annotations of **A** and **B** can be divided as respectively $n$ and $k$ nodes into two disjoint and independent sets $U$ and $V$ in an acyclic bipartite graph (based on: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)). In this bipartite graph every edge connects a node in $U$ to one in $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/bipartite.jpg\" width=\"220\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [IAA algorithm](iaa.py) then, **A**'s and **B**'s (or $U$ and $V$) sets of annotations of coreference classes and singletons are matched with function `match()` using a distance function `distance()` that calculates the Jaccard distance between the sets. The cost of the matching is calculated with the aforementioned `linear_sum_assignment` SciPy module. The results of the matching are stored in array $r$. The rest of the functions are helper functions that print the calculations to plain text files with extension `.iaa`. These `.iaa` files are found [here](iaa-files)."

    "The calculated IAA measures express a certain degree of disagreement between annotators **A** and **B**. Since the IAA measures do not speak for themselves, they need to be interpreted. Questions that are important for the interpretation of the IAA measures are: How come the IAA measure of this text is are so high? How come **A** and **B** disagree on a certain class matching? What are the differences between their annotations? To give the interpretation and IAA analyis structure, the IAA measures are analysed according to a categorisation of various disagreement types. The categorisation used here is an adapted version of the description from the [OntoNotes CoNNL 2012 shared task](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2391181.2391183), p. 8. \n",

    "* *Annotator Error*: an annotator error. This is a catch-all category for errors that do not fit in the other categories. \n",
    "* *Genuine Ambiguity*: genuine ambiguous cases where annotators interpret the referent(s) differently.  \n",
    "* *Generics*: one annotator considers a mention generic and the other annotator does not. This a hard category, since the context of Hebrew Bible texts is far away in time and often unclear. \n",
    "* *Guidelines*: the guidelines should be more clear on this example. \n",
    "* *Referents*: each annotator thought this was referring to two completely different things. \n",
    "* *NP*: one annotator did not mark this nominal phrase. \n",
    "* *Suffix*: one annotator did not mark this suffix. \n",
    "* *Verb*: one annotator did not mark this verb. \n",
    "* *Independent Personal Pronoun*: one annotator did not mark this IPP. \n",

'DBR&BLJ<L' occurs in a clause that does not directly precede 'JDBQ'. 'JDBQ' is preceded by the clause 'I hate the doing of (the) faithless', '>FH SVJM 'FN>TJ'. It is therefore more probable that 'JDBQ' corefers as follows: 'the doing of the faithless, it/he does not cling to me'. Both **A** and **B** have clearly interpreted these mentions differently, the differences are therefore categorised as ambiguity. 2x _Genuine Ambiguity_ for **B**'s diff in *C3*, 2x for **A** adding JDBQ' and 'DBR&BLJ<L' to his singletons. Though '>FH' is clearly an infinitive that should not be annotated, it functions together with 'SVJM' as an 'NP': 'the doing of the faithless'. **A** has not annotated '>FH', **B** adds '>FH' to his singletons: 2x _Genuine Ambiguity_. \n",

These 9 mentions plus 'MWCJ<' are **B**'s *C6* class which is matched with **A**'s *C11*. **A** adds 'MWCJ<' in 17:7 (NP vocative, Msg, 'saviour'/'helper') to his singleton set. The difference of mentions as indicated by **A**'s diff for this *C1* - *C11* match seems to be caused by a linking error made in brat by **B**. All mentions (verbs: 'HV', 'CM<', 'HPLH', 'CMR', 'TSTJR'; suffixes 'K') refer in 2Msg to God. **A** forgot to link 'MWCJ<' to this class: 2x _Annotator Error_ (1x for the diff, 1x for the singletons). **B**'s linking error is counted as 18x _Annotator Error_ (2 x 9 for both diffs, ).

The first occurrence of 'NPC' in 17:9 is an undetermined NP, but clearly refers to the soul of the I person that is being threatened by enemies. This can be inferred from the three suffixes 1Csg that occur in this verse. The 'I', the 'NPC' or self is under threat. The second occurence of 'NPC' in 17:13 is a determined NP with a 1Csg suffix. Here the same I person asks God to save him ('my soul') from 'the sword' (i.e. a threat) of the enemy. These two differences are categorised as 4 cases of _Genuine Ambiguity_ (2x diff, 2x singletons).\n",

    "    * **A** adds seven mentions to his *C6* class that **B** misses. **B**'s diff indicates that he has added two mentions ('DWD' and  'TJ') that **A** misses. Starting with those, 'DWD' (nomen proprium, 'David') belongs to the title of Ps 17. As was the case with Ps 67, according to the guidelines titles of Psalms are annotated for coreference but are not connected to coreference information in the rest of the Psalm. 'TJ' is supposed to be the suffix 1Csg 'J', it is connected to '>MRT' ('word') in 17:6, but **B** has erroneously also annotated the 'T'. **B**'s 'DWD' and  'TJ' is 5x an _Annotator Error_ (2x for the diff, 3x for the *S*). This also explains two of the differences in **A**'s and **B**'s *S*, namely: 'DWD' and '>MRT'. \n",
    "    * For the remaining differences, the seven mentions in **A**'s *C6*, there are two explanations. The first one is that the difference is a result of Genuine Ambiguity. In the *C8* - *C8* match, **B**'s *C8* agrees with the seven mentions in **A**'s *C6* diff, except for '>FB<H' (verb, 1Csg, 'to be sated') and the aforementioned (T)'J' suffix 1Csg. While **B** explictely identifies his *C5*, which contains 1Csg mentions, as 'David'. **A** leaves the 1Csg mentions class unidentified. Possibly, **B** started a new coreference class because of the sudden occurrence of the suffix 'NW' (1Cpl) in 17:11. Strangely, **B** adds '>XZH' (verb, 1Csg, 'to see') in 17:15 to his *C8* class, but leaves '>FB<H' in the same verse out which is then added to *S*. In terms of consistency '>FB<H', 'I am sated', should also have been added to this class. The second explanation - the difference is a result of an _Annotator Error_ - is therefore more probable. **B** did not link all the 1Csg mentions correctly. We count 12x an _Annotator Error_ (6x for **A**'s *C6* diff and **B**'s *C8* diff).\n",

The translation of this part of 17:7 would be: 'Oh you helper [God] for those who seek refuge from those who arise against your [God] right hand'.

    "    * **A** and **B** differ on their understanding of the lion metaphor in 17:12 with translation: 'His likeness is of a lion, he longs to tear; and like a young lion who sits in a hiding place'. **B** annotates two classes. **B** links 'KPJR' ('young lion') to 'JCB' (participle, Msg, 'to sit') in 17:12 in a separate class *C10*. **A** links these two mentions to '>RJH' ('lion') and 'JKSWP' (verb, 3Msg, to 'to long') in one *C10* class: '>RJH', 'JKSWP', 'KPJR', 'JCB'.  **B** adds 'VRWP' (infinitive cst, 'to tear') to his *C10*. According to the annotation guidelines infinitives are not annotated unless there is lexical identity with the same verb elsewhere. 'To tear' does not occur elsewhere in Ps 17, 'VRWP' is therefore 1x an _Annotator Error_. The question is then: do 'the lion' and 'the young lion' corefer or not, are they the same referents? Though a young lion is still a lion, it is probable in this text that the two lions are not the same. Therefore: 4x a case of _Referents_ (2x for **B**'s *C10* diff, 2x for **A**'s *C9* diff).\n",

    "    * The IAA meausure can be explained for a great part by a discussion of the *C3* - *C8* match in combination with **B**'s unpaired classes. \n",
    "    * Both **A** and **B** recognise an 'I' (1Csg)/ 'You' (2Msg) class, but **A** connects more mentions to his class than **B** to his. The 'I' person starts to speak in 32:3 and stops in 32:8 where YHWH speaks in the 1Csg. Since the 'I' person in 32:3 -- 32:8 is probably the same person, e.g. a supplicant, **B** seems to have made a linking error, hence creating his unpaired *C3*. **B**'s *C3* contains 5 1Csg references, but only the first 3 ('HXRCTJ', 'J', 'TJ') can be counted in 32:3. The other two ('J', 'J') occur in 32:4. **B**'s *C7* contains only 2 ('J', suffix; '>WDJ<', verb) of the 8 1Csg mentions from 32:5, the other 6 are added to his matched *C8* class. This division of these 8 1Csg mentions and **B**'s unpaired *C3* and *C7* are probably caused by making linking errors in brat during annotation. In addition, 'TJ' is an erroneous annotation of the suffix 'J' of the substantive 'C>GT' ('roaring'). This results in a difference in **A**'s and **B**'s *S*: ('C>GT', 8) versus ('C>G', 9). We count 17x _Annotator Error_ (9x for the missed 1Csg mentions, 8x for the unpaired diffs).\n",
    "    * **A** also adds ('THJW', 20) and ('K', 21) to his *C3* class. Both mentions occur in 32:9. In the previous verse, 32:8, a 2Msg is addressed. The sudden change to the 2Mpl of 'THJW' (verb, 'to be') in 32:9 is hard to follow and ambiguous: is the 2Msg the same as the 2Mpl? Probably not, but who or what they are remains unclear. We count 4x _Genuine Ambiguity_ (2x for **A**'s *C3* diff, 2x for **B**'s *C12* diff). The infinitive construct ('BLWM', 'to curb') annotated by **B** in his unpaired *C12* has no lexical identity with another occurrence of the same verb, it is therefore 1x _Annotator Error_. \n",

The 'righteous' and 'all the upright of heart' seem to be two different entities, therefore **B** is right in annotating two classes. We count 2x a linking error for **A**: 1 for the linking of 'YDJQJM' and 'KL&JCRJ&LB' and 1 for linking those mentions to **A**'s *C3*. These 5 mentions are counted as 5x _Annotator Error_.\n",

    "\n",
    "The 35 annotator errors can be fixed. In the analysis of Psalm 32 but also in previous analyses, the difference in some of the annotations between **A** and **B** was a result of linking errors and not necessarily the erroneous annotation of mentions. The consequence of a linking error however is that coreference classes are built up and matched differently, but also that the interpretation of the text is (essentially) different. In some sense, the IAA measures express this difference in interpretation. In the analyses to come the linking error will be distinguished, but is not added to the categorisation of disagreement types. "

If 'J<BD' refers to the Levites, the infinitives are annotated as mention and corefered with the Levites.

This is 2x _Annotator Error_. The question of interpretation is to whom the 3Msg of 'J<BD' refers (**B**'s ('J<BD', 61)): to the Levites or the retired Levites in 8:25 ('BN XMCJM CNH', adjunct NP, a son/man of fifty years)? **A**'s annotation of *C36* points to the latter: 'From (a son/man of fifty years ['BN XMCJM CNH']) (he will return ['JCWB']) from regular work and (he will work ['J<BD']) no more. (He serves ['CRT']) (his ['W']) brothers ... and (he does not work ['J<BD'])'. **B** links however 'CRT', 'W' and 'J<BD' to the Levites (*C22*) class. **B** thus considers these three mentions to refer to the Levites, not to the retired Levites. **B** does link one 'J<BD' to his *C36*, but the verb has the same subject (retired Levites) as the 'J<BD' that **B** linked to *C22*. Though the retired Levites were part of the Levites, they are clearly referred here as a different group that is separate from the Levites serving in the tent of meeting. 6x _Annotator Error_. \n",

The first three annotations of '<BD' in **A**'s *C22* are erroneous. The same goes for 3x '<BD' in **B**'s *C22*. They do not have any lexical identity with verbs or substantiva in their respective verses. According to that same principle '<BD' and '<BDT' can be coreferenced in a seperate class. 6x _Annotator Error_. \n",

    "    * Of the four occurrences of 'TNWPH' (substantive, Fsg, 'offering') in Nu 8 **B** links one to *C18* since the Levites are presented to JHWH as a(n) (symbolic) offering. The other three mentions of 'TNWPH' are added to his singletons. **A** adds all four mentions to his unpaired *C17*. **A** should have added one of those mentions to his *C18*, but unlike **B** he is right in corefering the other three mentions of 'TNWPH'. That makes 2 + 6 = 8x _Annotator Error_.\n",
    "    * **B** links '<FW' (verb, 3Cpl, 'to make') in 8:22 to his Levites class, i.e. *C22*. **A** adds the verb to his singletons. The 3Cpl refers to the preceding 'PNJ >HRN W PNJ BNJ', 'the face of Aaron and the face of (his) sons', and not the Levites. In the ETCBC representation the adjunct NP looks like this: 'LPNJ >HRN WLPNJ BNJW'. The annotator leaves out the prepositions in  brackets: (L)PNJ >HRN W (L)PNJ BNJ-W. The suffix -W is annotated separately, it refers to Aaron. The annotation guidelines exclude the annotation of prepositions within and as mentions. The annotation tool brat poses a problem here: nested mentions cannot be corefered, which can be seen in the *C32* - *C18* and *C33* - *C19* matchings. The suffix 'W' refers to 'PNJ >HRN and '<FW' refers to 'PNJ >HRN W PNJ BNJ'. Accordingly, **A** annotates 'PNJ BNJ' and 'PNJ BNJ' seperately in his *C33* and links 'PNJ >HRN' with corefering suffixes in his *C32*. '<FW' is added to **A**'s singletons. **B** links 2x 'PNJ BNJ' to his *C19* together with 'JKPR' (explicit subject is Aaron), 'W' and 'HM' (refers to the Levites). **B**'s ('KPR', 0), ('JKPR', 2), ('>HRN', 3), ('W', 5) and ('HM', 6) do not corefer with 'PNJ BNJ'. Nor does '<FW' corefer with the Levites. That means: 12x _Annotator Error_. Since brat's inflexibility with nested mentions, the 2x suffix 'W' can be referred to both 'PNJ >HRN' and '>HRN'. **B**'s ('W', 1), ('W', 3) in C32 are categorised as 2x _brat_. \n",
